SMOP created by AI


Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea:
A mobility provider calles SMOP (Smart Mobility Platform) for electric vehicles like e-cars, e-schoter, e-cargobikes as a greenfield project the cloud and microservice based. It servers as a platform to combine these external provider in the sense that a customer would not realize that he is using a combination of different electric vehicle providers to book a route in a city like berlin to travel from A to B. The payment process and all functionalities like plan a routing with multiple electric vehicles for a single route should be seamless for the customer."
