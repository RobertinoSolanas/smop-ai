# Smart Mobility Platform (SMOP) - Developer Specification

## 1. Overview
SMOP (Smart Mobility Platform) is a cloud-based, microservices-driven platform designed to seamlessly integrate multiple electric vehicle providers. Users can book multi-modal trips (e-cars, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes) without realizing they are using different providers. Payments and routing are handled seamlessly to enhance the user experience.

## 2. Key User Roles
### 2.1. Mr. Huber (Owner)
- Access to a **business dashboard**
- Manage **provider partnerships**
- View **financial reports and platform analytics**

### 2.2. Cloud Experts
- Responsible for **cloud infrastructure setup**
- **Deployment and monitoring** of microservices
- Ensure **scalability and security** of the platform

### 2.3. Customers
- **Register/Login** via mobile or web
- **Plan and book trips** combining multiple electric vehicle providers
- **Make seamless payments** for multi-provider routes
- **Track rides** in real-time
- **Receive notifications** (booking confirmation, updates, etc.)
- **View ride history and manage profiles**

## 3. Platform Support
- **Mobile Applications:** iOS & Android
- **Web Application:** Responsive web portal

## 4. Core Features
### 4.1. Routing System
- Users can search for **multi-modal routes** (combining different electric vehicles)
- **Optimization preferences:** Fastest, Cheapest, or Eco-friendly
- **Automatic vehicle switching suggestions**
- **Real-time vehicle availability and battery level** consideration
- **Traffic-aware routing**

### 4.2. External Provider Integration
- **API-based vehicle provider integration**
- **Standardized data model** for vehicle availability, pricing, and location
- **Middleware layer** to handle bookings and payments

### 4.3. Payment System
- **Single seamless payment** per trip, SMOP handles provider payments
- **Pricing calculation based on provider rates**
- **No additional user fees**, only standard provider rates apply

## 5. Architecture & Technology Stack
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (or similar scalable solution)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python (FastAPI) with microservices
- **Frontend:** React (Web) + React Native (Mobile)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for structured/unstructured data)
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0, JWT-based authentication
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe / Adyen / PayPal
- **Real-time Data Handling:** WebSockets / MQTT for live vehicle updates
- **API Gateway & Load Balancing:** Kubernetes with Nginx / AWS API Gateway
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch

## 6. Data Handling & Security
- **Data Encryption:** TLS 1.2+ for all communications, AES-256 for sensitive data
- **Personal Data Protection:** GDPR-compliant user data management
- **Access Control:** Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles
- **Transaction Security:** PCI-DSS compliance for payments

## 7. Error Handling Strategies
- **Graceful Failures:** In case of provider API failures, suggest alternative routes
- **Retry Logic:** Implement exponential backoff for API calls
- **Error Logging:** Centralized logging with alerts for critical failures
- **User Notifications:** Inform users of booking failures or trip modifications

## 8. Testing Plan
### 8.1. Unit Testing
- Test individual **microservices** for functionality
- Validate **routing logic**, **payment handling**, and **authentication**

### 8.2. Integration Testing
- Ensure **smooth provider API integration**
- Validate **real-time vehicle updates and tracking**
- Test **multi-modal trip calculations**

### 8.3. Performance Testing
- Load testing for **high user traffic**
- Stress testing on **database and API calls**

### 8.4. Security Testing
- **Penetration testing** to identify vulnerabilities
- **Data protection validation** (GDPR, PCI-DSS compliance)

### 8.5. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Beta testing with real users for usability feedback
- Validation of **end-to-end booking experience**
